## Description:
This code is based on [Circulating tumor DNA sequencing in colorectal cancer patients treated with first-line chemotherapy with anti-EGFR.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-95345-4). 

This code aims to identify potential variant allele frequency changes that serve as biomarkers for monitoring treatment response and tumor evolution.
