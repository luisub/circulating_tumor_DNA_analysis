## Description:
This code is based on [Circulating tumor DNA sequencing in colorectal cancer patients treated with first-line chemotherapy with anti-EGFR.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-95345-4). 

This code aims to identify potential variant allele frequency changes that serve as biomarkers for monitoring treatment response and tumor evolution. Then, Digital PCR Assay Development is implemented based on variant allele detection.

## Pipeline source code:

**[Source Code](vca_pipeline.ipynb)** - Jupyter notebook containing the VCA pipeline.


## Droplet Digital PCR  (ddPCR) Assay Design

**[ddPCR Design Notebook (development)](dev/dpcr_rare_mutation_detection.ipynb)** - Simulate Droplet Digital PCR assays for absolute quantification of ctDNA.

- Allele-specific probe design (FAM/VIC dual-color assays)
- Droplet partitioning simulation using Poisson statistics
- Limit of detection (LOD) calculations (down to 0.01% VAF)
- 1D Amplitude plots

## Project Planning Documents

**[TODO List](TODO.md)** - Comprehensive development roadmap with prioritized tasks.


## Data

**Source:** NCBI SRA BioProject [PRJNA714799](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA714799)

**Samples:** Circulating tumor DNA from colorectal cancer patients collected at multiple timepoints:
- Pre-treatment (baseline)
- During treatment (first follow-up)
- Post-treatment (final timepoint)
